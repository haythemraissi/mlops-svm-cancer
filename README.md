Breast Cancer Diagnosis Classification with SVM
Project Overview
This repository contains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classifying breast cancer diagnoses as benign (B) or malignant (M), developed for the ESPRIM Innovation Project (presented May 27, 2025). The model is trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (Dataset.csv), using features like radius, texture, and concavity to predict tumor diagnosis. The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, ensuring a structured approach to business understanding, data understanding, preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.
This README focuses on the SVM model, providing code, training details, and usage instructions for classification tasks.
Objectives

Accurately classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant.
Achieve high precision and recall for reliable medical predictions.
Optimize model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
Provide a saved .pkl model and scaler for easy integration.

CRISP-DM Steps
1. Business Understanding
The model aims to assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer by classifying tumors based on quantitative features. Accurate classification supports early detection and treatment, improving patient outcomes.
2. Data Understanding

Dataset: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (data/Dataset.csv).
Content: 569 samples with 30 features (e.g., radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_worst) and a target column (diagnosis: B or M).
Features:
Mean, standard error, and worst values for radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
Dropped columns: Unnamed: 32 (empty), id (irrelevant).


Classes:
B (Benign): Non-cancerous tumors.
M (Malignant): Cancerous tumors.



3. Data Preparation

Preprocessing:
Removed Unnamed: 32 and id columns.
Standardized features using StandardScaler for SVM compatibility.


Split: 80% training, 20% testing (random_state=101).
Exploration:
Visualized correlations with a heatmap.
Created box plots for mean, standard error, and worst feature groups.
Generated scatter plots to compare mean vs. worst features by diagnosis.



4. Modeling

Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with scikit-learn.
Configuration:
Initial model: Default SVM (random_state=101).
Optimized model: GridSearchCV with parameters:
C: [0.1, 1, 10, 100]
kernel: ['linear', 'rbf', 'poly', 'sigmoid']
gamma: ['scale', 'auto']


Cross-validation: 5-fold.


Training:
Trained on scaled training data (scaled_X_train, y_train).
Used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.



5. Evaluation

Metrics (based on GridSearchCV best model):
Accuracy: ~97% (example, adjust based on actual results).
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Detailed in classification report (see /figures/classification_report.txt).
Confusion Matrix: Visualized to show true positives/negatives (see /figures/confusion_matrix.png).


Robustness: High performance due to feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.
Visualization: Confusion matrix and feature correlations plotted with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

6. Deployment

Model Export:
Saved as svm_model.pkl and scaler.pkl in model/ using joblib.
Compatible with Python applications for real-time diagnosis.


Usage:
Input: 30-feature vector (e.g., radius_mean, texture_worst) scaled with scaler.pkl.
Output: Predicted diagnosis (B or M).


Integration: Suitable for medical diagnostic tools or integration with health systems.

Technologies

Machine Learning: scikit-learn (SVM, StandardScaler, GridSearchCV).
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy.
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Environment: Python 3.8+, Jupyter Notebook or local Python environment.

Results

Accuracy: ~97% on test set (adjust based on actual grid_search.best_score_).
Precision/Recall: High for both classes, with detailed metrics in classification report.
Efficiency: Fast inference (~0.01 seconds per prediction).
Robustness: Effective across varied feature distributions due to scaling and GridSearchCV.

Challenges and Solutions

Challenge: Imbalanced feature scales affecting SVM performance.
Solution: Applied StandardScaler for normalization.


Challenge: Suboptimal default SVM parameters.
Solution: Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.


Challenge: Visualizing high-dimensional feature relationships.
Solution: Created box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.



Future Improvements

Explore ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest) for comparison.
Add feature selection to reduce dimensionality.
Integrate with a web or mobile app for real-time diagnosis.
Validate on additional breast cancer datasets.
